# Challenge NodeJS

## Tasks

1. Download this repository
2. Create an ExpressJS (or any nodejs framework) app that accomplishes the following:

    1. On the app initialization will do:

        - Connect to the Github API
        - Find the node (https://github.com/nodejs/node) repository
        - Obtain list of branches and store it in a JSON file

    2. This app will have 3 routes:

        - Route to show the branches of the repo in a html rendered list with his author
        - A route like /author/:author to show the public repos of the user

3. Commit and Push your code to your new repository
4. Send us the link to prevent copy between candidates, we will review your the code and get back to you. Send us a link to: jobs@fact2value.com

## Notes
- Remeber that you have to commit regularly to show us how you work with git.
- Maybe github ban your ip, so you will need to make a good cache ;)


## Nice to have

- Basic task completed
- Code organization
- Readable code
- ES6 ready?
- Typescript version
- Route for refresh the JSON db, thoughts about the system, improved version
- Docker file to compose a docker image of that
- Scalability

### Dont forget

We would be interested in your thoughts on these topics, without necessarily implementing them. What would you do, how your choices would depend on, what technologies you would integrate... If you have remarks / thoughts on other topics that those mentionned, don't hesitate!

#### May the force by with you! =P
